Amazing visualizations for categorical and continuous variables

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the population distribution of East African countries using data from the World Bank. The dataset includes population figures from 1960 to 2024, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of demographic trends over time.

## Data Sources

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

The data cleaning process involved several key steps:
1. **Filtering East African Countries**: The dataset is filtered to include only East African countries.
2. **Data Transformation**: The data is transformed from a wide format to a long format, making it easier to analyze.
3. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values are handled appropriately to ensure data quality. Since some rows contained entire missing years, these rows were dropped from the dataset.
4. **Saving Processed Data**: The cleaned and filtered data is saved for future analysis.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) process involves several key steps:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode) for the population data.
2. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze population trends over the years for each East African country.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare population distributions between different countries.
4. **Visualization**: Create visualizations (e.g., line charts, bar charts) to represent the findings.

## Conclusion

The analysis of the population distribution in East African countries reveals significant trends and patterns. The visualizations created during the exploratory data analysis provide valuable insights into the demographic changes over time. Future work could involve more granular analyses, such as examining the impact of specific events on population growth or exploring the relationship between population dynamics and economic indicators.
